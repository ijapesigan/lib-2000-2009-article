  abstract = {In applications of structural equation modeling, it is often desirable to obtain measures of uncertainty for special functions of model parameters. This article provides a didactic discussion of how a method widely used in applied statistics can be employed for approximate standard error and confidence interval evaluation of such functions. The described approach is illustrated with data from a cognitive intervention study, in which it is used to estimate time-invariant reliability in multiwave, multiple indicator models.},
