  abstract = {Factors that influence the relation between extraversion and pleasant affect were examined in 6 studies. In Studies 1 through 5, the authors used structural equation modeling techniques to test whether different extraversion and pleasant affect scales and the use of multiple methods of assessment influenced the strength of the relation. In Study 6, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of previous literature to calculate an average effect size and to assess the influence of moderator variables. Results from both the structural equation models and the meta-analysis showed that with only a few exceptions, the use of different extraversion and affect scales resulted in moderate to strong correlations. The use of ``on-line'' methods of mood assessment (moment reports or daily-diary reports) resulted in lower and more homogeneous correlations than did the use of global, retrospective measures of mood.},
